      <h1>About the 3D Art Gallery</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to our virtual 3D Art Gallery. Here, you can navigate through a
        variety of wonderful artworks and learn about their history and
        significance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is brought to you by Emilian Kasemi. We believe in the
        power of art to inspire, provoke thought, and communicate across
        cultures and epochs. Our mission is to make art accessible to everyone,
        regardless of location or background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to explore and engage with the artworks. The gallery is best
        experienced in full-screen mode. For optimal navigation, use the arrow
        keys or the W, A, S, and D keys. You can also use your mouse to change
        the viewing direction. Additional information about the artworks will
        appear on your screen as you approach them.
